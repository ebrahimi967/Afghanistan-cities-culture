     <p class="para">Afghanistan is located between Iran and Pakistan in southwest Asia. Afghanistan’s physical geography is severe, consisting mainly of inhospitable desert and high mountains. The central mountain range, the Hindu Kush, begins in the northeast of Afghanistan in the Pamiri Knot, a region of highlands where the mountain ranges of Afghanistan, Tajikistan, China, Pakistan, and India meet. This region, known as the “roof of the world,” has many ranges higher than 20,000 feet in elevation. The Hindu Kush range extends across central Afghanistan from northeast to southwest. The central mountain region in Afghanistan is known as Hazarajat, a largely inaccessible area with a sparse population. The deserts are in the southwest along the borders with Iran and Pakistan. In the north, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, and Konduz are located on a series of lower-lying plains and river valleys.</p>
